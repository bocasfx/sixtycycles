          Drone is a 3D web application that allows the user to enjoy visual and auditory experiences by freely navigating within its environment. By getting closer to a three-dimensional body the user enters its aural radio of influence triggering the body’s atmospheric sounds. Each three-dimensional body generates a different sound which is a combination of individual sound loops which try to be representative of the geometry of the body.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-description">
          The body’s individual loops are completely independent of each other and mixed in real-time depending on the three-dimensional position of the user in the environment.
