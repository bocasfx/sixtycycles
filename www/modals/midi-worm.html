        <p class="sc-modal-text">MidiWorm is yet another soft MIDI controller. The worm is composed of 10 nodes. Each node is a MIDI message generator. Whether a message is generated depends on a probability calculated by the node and the nodeâ€™s position on the screen. On the screen, the x-axis represents notes and the y-axis represents the velocity of the notes. It is possible to select predefined musical scales so only the notes that belong to the selected scale are played.</p>
